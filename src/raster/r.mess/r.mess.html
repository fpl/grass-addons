<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.mess</em> computes the multivariate environmental similarity 
(MES) [1], which measures how similar environmental conditions in one 
area are to those in a reference area. This can also be used to compare 
environmental conditions between current and future scenarios. See the 
supplementary materials of Elith et al. (2010) [1] for more details.

<p>
Besides the MES, <em>r.mess</em> computes the individual similarity 
layers (IES - the user can select to delete these layers) and, 
optionally, several other layers that help to further interpret the MES 
values:

<p>
<ul>
<li>The area where for at least one of the variables has a value
that falls outside the range of values found in the reference set.</li>
<li>The most dissimilar variable (MoD).</li>
<li>The sum of the IES layers where IES &lt; 0. This is similar to
the NT1 measure as proposed by Mesgaran et al. 2014 [2].</li>
<li>The number of layers with negative values.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The user can compare a set of reference (baseline) conditions to 
projected (test) conditions. The reference conditions are defined by a 
set of environmental raster layers (<b>ref_env</b>). To specify the 
reference area, one of the following can be used:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>ref_rast</b> = reference raster layer: A raster with values of 1 
and 0 (or nodata). Reference conditions are derived from the locations 
where the raster value is 1.</li>
<li><b>ref_vect</b> = reference vector point layer: Reference conditions 
are taken for the point locations in the vector layer.</li>
<li><b>ref_region</b> = reference region: Only areas within the 
specified region's boundaries are considered as the reference 
area.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If no reference raster map, vector map, or region is provided, the entire 
area covered by the input environmental raster layers is used as the 
reference area.

<p>
The projected (test) conditions are defined by a second set of 
environmental variables (<b>proj_env</b>). They can represent future 
conditions in the same area (similarity across time), or conditions in 
another area (similarity between two different areas). If a projection 
region (<b>proj_region</b>) is provided, the MESS (and other layers) 
will be limited to that region.

<p>
If <b>proj_env</b> is not provided, the MESS value of a raster cell 
represents how similar the conditions in that cell are compared to the 
medium conditions across the whole area.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The examples below use the bioclimatic variables bio1 (mean annual
temperature), bio12 (annual precipitation), and bio15 (precipitation
seasonality) in Kenya and Uganda. All climate layers (current and
future) are from <a href="http://www.worldclim.org">Worldclim.org</a>.
The protected areas layer includes all nationally designated protected
areas with a IUCN category of II or higher from <a
href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">protectedplanet.net</a>.

<h3>Example 1</h3>

The simplest case is when only a set of reference data layers (<b>ref_env
</b>) is provided. The multi-variate similarity values of the resulting
map are a measure of how similar conditions in a location are to the
median conditions in the whole region.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=bio1
r.mess ref_env=bio1,bio12,bio15 output=Ex_01
</pre></div>

<p>
Thus, in the following maps, the value in each pixel represents how 
similar conditions are in that pixel to the median conditions in the 
entire region, in  terms of mean annual temperature (bio1), mean annual 
precipitation (bio12),  precipitation seasonality (bio15) and the three 
combined (MES).

<h3>Example 2</h3>

In the second example, conditions in the whole region are compared to
those in the region's protected areas (ppa), which thus serves as the
 reference/sample area. See
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121444">van Breugel et
al.(2015)</a> [3] for an example of how this can be useful.

<p>
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=bio1
r.mess -m -n -i ref_env=bio1,bio12,bio15 ref_rast=ppa output=Ex_02
</pre></div>

<p>
In the figure below the map with the protected areas, the MES, the most
dissimilar variables, and the areas with novel conditions are given.
They show that the protected areas cover most of the region's annual
precipitation, mean annual temperature, and precipitation seasonality
gradients. Areas with novel conditions can be found in northern Kenya.

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Similarity between long-term average conditions based on the period
1950-2000 (<b>ref_env</b>) and projections for climate conditions in
2070 under RCP85 based on the IPSL General Circulation Models (<b>
proj_env</b>). No reference points or areas are defined in this
example, so the whole region is used as a reference. 

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=bio1
r.mess ref_env=bio1,bio12,bio15 proj_env=IPSL_bio1,IPSL_bio12,IPSL_bio15
output=Ex_03
</pre></div>

<p>
Results (below) shows that there is a fairly large area with novel
conditions. Note that in the <i>MES</i> map, the values are based on
the highest negative value across the input variables (here bio1,
bio12, bio15). In the <i>SumNeg</i> map, values of all input variables
are summed when negative. The <i>Count</i> map shows for each raster
cell how many variables have negative similarity scores. Thus, the
values in the <i>MES</i> and <i>SumNeg</i> maps only differ where the
MES of more than one variable is negative (dark gray areas in the
<i>Count</i> map).
